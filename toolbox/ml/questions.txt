1. The accuracy curve increases at a decreasing rate.
2. The lower end of the curve seems to have more noise, because it has less data to learn from and therefore varies wildly in accuracy.
3. The graph becomes satisfyingly smooth after about 100 trials.
4. Larger values of C result in much higher accuracies overall.
